# Library-Management-System

The Library Management System is a GUI application designed to efficiently manage library transactions. Developed using the Tkinter module in Python, this project was created for submission as a Class 12 CBSE project.

# Introduction

Have you ever felt sad for not going to the library and borrowing some books during this COVID situation? My friends and I have made an application to solve this problem as we are book worms too and wanted to relax our mind by reading. We are good at programming so we thought of making a library application
This interface supports all members and the librarian to process transactions with computers using Python and MySQL. This system can authorize members and provide details accordingly. To make it secure, features like OTP verification and Captcha codes have also been added to increase overall security and productivity of the library and prevent data theft or mismatches. The librarian can keep track of books and the library members. The Librarian can lend, renew, reserve physical books. A new page namely "e-book" has been added to enable the members to read books from their homes as they would do in the library.
In addition, the members can communicate with the librarian through a built-in mailing system in case they are facing any difficulties from home. Borrowing, returning, renewing of books will be notified to the library members by their email id. This is really a user friendly application to be used in this condition. The latest version of the software includes both a mac and windows version.
Members can now enjoy hassle free and faster process transactions...

# About the programming tool used

The programming language used is python Idle 3.0 in a mac system. MYSQL has been used for storing data and retrieving data from database.
Python is an interpreted, object oriented, high level programming language. Python has an easy to learn syntax which emphasizes readability and hence reduces the cost of program maintenance to a huge extent. Python is used in many application domains, such as web and internet development, education, etc.
Python was created and released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
With the number of advantages python has, here are some key features of python to be noted, its an expressive language, object oriented language, extensible, large number of libraries, integrated, embeddable, GUI programming support, etc.
The following python program also uses a standard GUI library, called tkinter, which when combined with python, provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.


# Problem Definition

The Library Management system is an application software which allows the members to perform seamless transactions, for borrowing, returning books. It also helps in keeping track of overdue books and user management through a user friendly interface.
The existing library management system is simple and isn't secure as humans can easily override the system and perform unauthorized transactions. The existing systems also focus mainly on functionality hence user interaction is limited.
A paradigm shift of the human administration methods to the digital administration methods will add a new and corruption-free dimension to the process of administration. The computer operator has user rights which prevent unauthorized access to database records. In order to improve upon the drawbacks of the current system, we have analysed the system thoroughly.
The new library system allows the members to create accounts which are secured by passwords and Captcha codes and email OTP’s. The Library stores all of the private information in an encrypted binary file which is not in the human readable form.
The system also allows users to create an account and keep track of all their transactions. The system also allows the members to communicate with the librarian through a built in mailing system.
In this system, members' credentials can be easily updated. Name, NRIC / Passport Number (Only last 4 characters), phone number and email address can be updated by the librarian whereas sensitive information such as passwords are updated by the members. even if the members forget their password, they can change it anytime.
The librarian’s account has also been designed suitably to cater to all the needs of the members. the librarian can perform all transactions for the members and can also update members details, add new books, update and delete information about events which are displayed in the main page. the librarian can also reply to emails.


# Design Requirements

A library management System is essentially a database management system which Caters the needs of various members, and their valuable interactions with the interface to ensure a smooth, and secure process.
Every member has to create an account to borrow a book from the library. The time taken to create an account should take less than 5 minutes to complete with various security features such as OTP’s and Passwords, The program is very safe and has the top most priority to protect every information about the members.
This System ensures privacy of the personal information of all the members, which is stored in a binary file unreadable by humans.
Any modifications to be done with respect to the information of the members can be done with the help of the librarian, prior to the knowledge of the members. The librarian is able to keep track of the list of all books borrowed, reserved and also notifies the member if she/he has a borrowed book past the due date.
